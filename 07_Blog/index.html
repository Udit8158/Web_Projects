            <h3>The Heaven For Bloggers</h3>
            <p>
              iBlog is a website which lets you submit an article which upon
              approval will be up on our website and you can get a good amount
              of reach from here! My Halloween decorations are staying in the
              box this year. To be honest, they didn’t make it out of the box
              last year either. My Halloween spirit has officially been
              bludgeoned to death by teenagers who no longer care and a
              persistent October fear of the Northern California wildfires. And
              speaking of fear, isn’t there more than enough of that going
              around? Maybe all of us can pretend that Halloween isn’t even
              happening this year?
